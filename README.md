# Resapp üìÖ

By **@alexisreis**, updated in August 2023

Web application to allow users to book resources on shared machines.

This application was developed as part of an **internship at Worldline Labs**, 
Villeurbanne in 2023. It was developed using **React**, **NodeJS** and **Remult**.  

2021.


## Functionalities implemented so far : üèÅ
* Known users can **log in** to access the app and API methods
* Authenticated users can see the list of **resource reservations in a calendar** (day, week, and month view)
* Authenticated users can **request a new resource reservation** (with start time, end time, duration and resources needed) 
* For a request, **the service proposes a list of possible reservation slots**, the user can then **choose the best slot and book the reservation**, at booking a mail is sent to the user with a `.ics` file
* Admins have access to a dashboard and restricted **API methods to manage machines** (**block** them for further reservations, **add** new machines and **delete** them)
* Admins have access to **statistics** about the usage of the service and the machines
* Admins can **change the admin status** of other users


## How to run the app ? üöÄ

If you are running this locally on your machine don't forget to set the environment variables or the server won't start.
Example :
```
ENV=DEV (or PROD)
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ACCOUNT=areis                       # must be your flastname (infra logs)
DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME=Alexis Reis                    # must be your name
DEFAULT_ADMIN_MAIL=alexis.reis@mail.com           # must be your mail
```


### Manual run (development mode) ‚úã
First thing you need to do is to install the dependencies :

```bash
npm install 
```

You can run both the client and the server manually and locally in development mode using these two command in two separate terminals :

* React client :

```bash
npm run dev
```

* NodeJS + Remult server :

```bash
npm run dev-node
```

* Run tests :

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will run the tests using Playwright and generate a report.

### With Docker üê≥

Just run this command : (don't forget to set the environment variables).

```bash
docker compose up
```

Alternatively you can also create the server container using these commands :  
It will install the dependencies, build the client and then run the server. 


```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t server .
docker run -it -p 3002:3002 server
```

The NodeJS client will be running and accessible on `localhost:3002`.
